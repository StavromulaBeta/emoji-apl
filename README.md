# 🙂 APL

This idea has been holding my brain hostage, I hope that implementing it will restore my free will.

## What?

It's APL, but instead of the symbols I used emojis. For example ¨ (each) is now 🍑 (peach), ∧ (and) is now 🐜 (ant), and ⌽ (reverse) is 🙃.

## How?

I didn't implement an entire APL for this (thank god), this uses GNU APL under the hood. You will need this installed. I wrote the translator itself in C, because APL didn't seem to like unicode strings much.

## Why?

Why not?

## Features

- Many terrible puns
- Names condense into flags to save space
- Arguably more intuitive symbols than normal APL
- There is no good reason to use this

## FAQ

### Why are the brackets 🤱 and 🎅?
The parens are parents.

### Why do identifiers turn into flags?
I don't know.

### An Emoji programming language already exists(?)
Yes, but [Emojicode](https://www.emojicode.org) is a traditional programming language, not an APL - where's the fun in that?

### How do I install this?
Make sure you have a C compiler and GNU APL, then run `make` and then `sudo make install`. The command to invoke the repl is `🙂apl` and you can pipe output to the repl such as `cat life.🙂apl | 🙂apl`.
